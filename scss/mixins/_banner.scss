    * Re-implemented for products by Atas Nalar.
    * Removed Prefixes (bs-) from data attributes and (bs.) from script variables and functions to simplify the code and make it more readable for us and to be applied on our project/products.
    *
    * Note: This file is a bundle of all customization between Sass & JS, we don't recommend editing the Sass files directly in this folder. Because it will be overwritten by us  when "New Updates" from Bootstrap are released.
