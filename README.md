== Customization ==

This Sass is based on Bootstrap ^5.2.3. Big thanks to all Bootstrap author & contributor. 

For information, we don't recommend editing the Sass files directly in this folder. This file has been re-implemented by Atas Nalar with some changes and will be overwritten by us when "New Updates" from Bootstrap are released.
